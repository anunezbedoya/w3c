This directory holds resources used by the checker frontend.

The HTML content of the frontend is dynamically emitted from server-side
Java code; the Java sources which emit that HTML are generated by the
checker build from the `*Emitter.xml` files in this directory.

To change the HTML content of the UI, make your changes to the appropriate
`*Emitter.xml` file in this directory and then from the top level of your
working directory, run a command similar to the following:

To regenerate the base HTML content for the frontend:
```
java -classpath jars/validator.jar nu.validator.xml.SaxCompiler
  site/PageEmitter.xml src/nu/validator/servlet/PageEmitter.java
```

To regenerate the form-controls part of the HTML content for the frontend:
```
java -classpath util/dist/io-xml-util.jar nu.validator.tools.SaxCompiler \
  site/FormEmitter.xml src/nu/validator/servlet/FormEmitter.java
```
